In this file, some aspects of advanced usage of EPA Classifier will be
explained in more detail.

1. Using a config file

    Both epa_classifier and epa_trainer can load their parameters from
    a config file, specified with a -c switch, e.g.:
    
        ./epa_classifier.py -r example/prokaryotes.json -q example/query.fa -c epac.cfg
    
    This option is especially helpful if you want to run EPA Classifier
    on several different machines, since you can put all the 
    machine-specific parameters (e.g. RAxML-SSE3/RAxML-AVX, number of 
    threads etc) into a single file.
    
    The sample configuration file - epac.cfg.local - will give you an
    idea of available parameters and their meaning.
   
2. Running RAxML on remote host

    Since RAxML run is the most heavy part of the pipeline, it sometimes
    make sense to "offload" its execution to the different machine. 
    EPA classifier provide two options for doing this:
    
    a) SSH
    
    Just add the following line to the [raxml] section of config file:
    
    raxml_remote_host=myhost
    
    b) Sun Grid Engine submission (SGE)
    
    To run RAxML on a cluster node, add following lines to the config 
    file:
    
        [cluster]
        run_on_cluster=true
        cluster_epac_home=/path/to/epac/on/cluster/node
        cluster_qsub_script=sandy.qsub

    The last parameter is an "empty" submission script, e.g.:
    
#!/bin/bash
#
#$ -cwd -V                  # Shift directories and export variables
#$ -q sandy.q               # Select the queue
#$ -pe mvapich12 12         # Set the parallel environment
#$ -l h_rt=24:00:00         # Request the time for the job
