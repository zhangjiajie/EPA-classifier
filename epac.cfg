# The following 4 parameters control taxonomy sampling, i.e. which
# sequences will be used to construct a reference tree

# Ignore all sequences which are only resolved to a rank *higher* than this value
# Given a standard 7-level taxonomy, value min_rank=5 means that we only use sequences which
# have a genus (rank=5) or species (rank=6) assigned, and ignore everything assigned to family/order/etc

min_rank=2

# The maximum number of sequences for each low-level taxon to be included in the tree
# E.g. with max_seqs_per_leaf=3, we only take at most 3 sequences for each species.
# In case of seqs attached directly to the higher ranks (genus/family/etc), the number 
# of included seqs will be higher and "proportional" to this value (s. code for details)
